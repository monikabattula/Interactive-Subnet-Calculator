# Building an interactive subnet calculator

Subnet calculator that using an IP address and a subnet mask given by the user will return five parameters.

The network address

The broadcast address 

The number of valid hosts per subnet

The wildcard mask

The number of mask bits.

Finally the subnet calculator should be able to generate one or more random IP addresses from the subnet in which our initial IP address resides.

Planning the application:

importing the modules that are needed afterthat need to check the validity of both the IP address and the subnet mask that the user enters at the prompt.
